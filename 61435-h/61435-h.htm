<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Some up-country contributor sends us in a
lengthy “poem” under the alluring caption,
“Ode to a Jackass.” This verse libertinage
starts off something in the following
fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, well do I remember yet,</div>
<div class="verse">How very proud I used to get</div>
<div class="verse">When, like a little king, I’d set—</div>
<div class="verse">Upon my donkey.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are several more verses which serve
as proof that out in the rhubarbs the molasses
candy is a mocker and soda pop a raging. The
only redeeming feature in free verse is its mystery.
Take this thing by Ellen Janson in “The
Measure” entitled “Shadowy—Under My Window,”
for example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Shadowy—under my window—</div>
<div class="verse">Your low reed sobs</div>
<div class="verse">Its desert love-song to the remembering stars.</div>
<div class="verse">Shadowy—</div>
<div class="verse">All the night my breasts are lilies,</div>
<div class="verse">My lips are passion flowers.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, there you are—a nice idea, neatly handled
and mysterious. Your guess as to what
Poetess Janson is driving at is as good as mine—and
both probably are wrong. Perhaps she
was talking to Fred Beauvais under her window,
or Jim Stillman. Or it may have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
alley cat—a thing sobbing in the backyard to
the remembering stars.</p>

<p>And so the mystery thickens like onion jelly.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We let Gus read both these poems—the
“Ode to a Jackass” and “Shadowy—Under
My Window”—and Gus called the
Shadowy stuff too highbrow. But Gus doesn’t
know “highbrow” poetry when he reads it.
Neither one is regular, lollypop highbrow literature.
We have before us a recent copy of
“Current Opinion” containing the following
howl from the highbrow poet, Carl Sandburg:</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">My shirt is a token and a symbol</div>
<div class="verse">More than a lover for sun and rain,</div>
<div class="verse">My shirt is a signal</div>
<div class="verse">And a teller of souls.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I can take off my shirt and tear it</div>
<div class="verse">And so make a ripping, razzly noise,</div>
<div class="verse">And the people will say,</div>
<div class="verse">“Look at him tear his shirt.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I can keep my shirt on;</div>
<div class="verse">I can sit around and sing like a little bird,</div>
<div class="verse">And look ’em all in the eye and never be fazed.</div>
<div class="verse">I can keep my shirt on.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we hadn’t happened across this copy of
Current Opinion enroute home from the Atlantic
City tea party we would have been just as
ignorant as Gus as to what constitutes real
highbrow poetry. We have known dames who
could translate the languages of their Mexican
hairless puppies. We have seen dumb-bells trying
to get a prescription from an ouija board.
Most poets—even the cuckoo who wrote the
“Ode to a Jackass”—are familiar with the
“voices of nature.” But unless we have been
eating a wagon load of evaporated apples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
smothered in bootleg without any flavor—especially
without vanilla flavor—Sandburg is
shadow-boxing with nut sundaes when he is not
writing poetry.</p>

<p>Sandburg is beyond all surgery.</p>

<p>But that is highbrow, Gus, granting the shirt
was clean, which we very much doubt.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">When Gus was back East with me where
they use the sign language—sign here
and sign there—we took in a New York
production and one of the comic lyrics handed
over the footlights went something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, the Vamp, Vamp, Vamp, Vamp, Vamp,</div>
<div class="verse">She’s a nectarine, a pippin and a peach;</div>
<div class="verse">She’s emotional and sexual and highly intellectual</div>
<div class="verse">And equally effectual in each.</div>
<div class="verse">She’s a jolly little sport with the boys of every sort,</div>
<div class="verse">In the college, in the court or in the camp—</div>
<div class="verse">Though her years may handicap her,</div>
<div class="verse">Why the flapping of the Flapper</div>
<div class="verse">Isn’t in it with the vamping of the Vamp, Vamp, Vamp,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the variable, veritable vamp.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nothing “highbrow” about that—yet we can
picture a crowd of Minneapolis undergraduates
sitting beside a big pine tree at our Breezy
Point lodge on a moonlight night. We shall
let you complete the portrayal. It isn’t poetry,
just as Gus says, and it isn’t highbrow like the
“Tale of the Shirt” and the “Lily Breasts.”
But, it should go ringing down in cabaret history
with “Cheer, Cheer, the Gang’s All Here”;
“Shall I Get You Now or Must I Hesitate?” and
other classics of the post-prohibition age.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>That thing you call a head is merely a
mole placed on your shoulders to keep your
backbone from unraveling.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">I was standing outside the Urban meat market
in Robbinsdale the other day when a
neighbor lady, carrying her baby, walked up
to me. “If you’ll hold baby while I buy some
meat I’ll treat you to a nice cool drink in the
drug store,” she said to me.</p>

<p>I took the kidlets in my arms while mother
did her shopping. I stood around for at least
five minutes before the kindly lady finally completed
her purchases.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Captain Billy,” she said, as she
took her baby from me. “I suppose you’re
ready for that drink now, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered. “Really, Mrs. Smith, I’m
not the least bit dry today.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We received a very interesting letter
from Deacon Gifford’s son, John, the
other day. Giff Junior went out to California
to become a movie hero and at present
has employment in Hollywood as a pilot in the
Universal stables. He piles it here and there
as he used to do in his father’s barn. We will
give you Giff’s letter as we feel sure you will
be interested in any word from our old friend
John.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dear Captain Billy: I went out to visit a
nice girl in Watts, California, twenty minutes’
ride from Los Angeles, tuther night and she
had a nice little vurse which she recited to me,
which I am sending you to put in the Whiz
Bang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>O, she shook a little shimmy,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Then she shook a little knee;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>She shook her little shoulder</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As she danced away with me.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Handsome feller shook an eyelid,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>’N she shook her’s back in glee,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Shook his head kinda sideways</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And directly she shook me.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Watts is a new town, as I have said before,
and the most popular man in town is Reverund
Ismus. He always is invited to every wedding
and funeral.</p>

<p>“I went to a home brew party the other
night, but before I got there the party was dead
and Reverund Ismus eridicated the burial
service, thusly:</p>

<p>“‘Brethren and Sistern, we must now bid a
fond farewell to Deacon Jones (here someone
in the audience remarked “What farewell could
be sweeter”), who now lies uninterrupted. We
must benefit by the Deacon’s calamity and teach
our children to read and write, that they may
be able to discern the difference between ‘Malt
and Hops’ and ‘Rough on Rats.’ The choir
will now sing ‘Awaken Sleeping Angels’ for
Brother Deacon Jones is now entering the gates
of Heaven.’</p>

<p>“We have a wonderful barber shop in town.
He isn’t doing much business now and when I
stepped in for a shave the other day he was
asleep in the chair. I coughed a couple of
times. He awoke, jumped up quick, and shouted,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Next!’</p>

<p>“They also have a police force in Watts.
Yesterday I saw him arrest a fellow in an auto.
The fellow wanted to know what he was
pinched for.</p>

<p>“‘Fer not sticking out yer hand when turning
a busy corner.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I couldn’t very well let go of the
wheel to stick out my hand, could I?’</p>

<p>“‘Where was yer other hand?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I had that around the emergency.’
Whereupon the girl sitting next to him blushed
furiously. I didn’t know why unless the cop
flirted with her or something. Women are awfully
funny anyway.</p>

<p>“By the way, Captain, is your present wife
your first mate?</p>

<p class="center">“Your old friend,</p>

<p class="right">“John.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ye editor received an interesting communication
the other day from our friend
A. Rouse, which we will pass on to you
for your edification:</p>

<p>“T’other night I passed through your summer
capital, i.e., Pequot, and in spite of the
uncouth hour, climbed off the rattler to see if
I could view the illustrious Gus or the famous
member of the specie bovine, Pedro. I was
disappointed, but what I started out to say was
that as we approached the aforementioned hamlet,
I remarked to George, the genial and dusky
skipper of the ‘Sokluk,’ that we seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

few miles.</p>

her back on the ties once mo.”</p>

<h3>Our Latest Flivver Story</h3>

<p>A jitney car operated by a woman between
Chico and Paradise, California, broke down
the other day. She halted a passing roadster
and of the driver inquired:</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about this car?”</p>

<p>“Only a lot of bum jokes,” he replied, and
drove on.</p>

<h3>Gone Are the Dog Daze</h3>

<p>Squire Green, wealthy Minnesota farmer,
had a pedigreed dog, Fido. He read in the
Weekly Argus where Professor Dumpey in
Minneapolis could operate on a dog and make
him talk like a man for a three thousand dollar
fee.</p>

<p>The squire shook himself loose from the
money and delegated his son, Bycyrus, to take
the money and Fido to the miracle professor.
Arriving in the city, Bycyrus parked Fido in
the hotel and started out to spend the three
thousand berries. When he sobered up, he
found himself without railroad fare home, so
he and Fido started to walk.</p>

<p>At the crossroads he killed Fido.</p>

<p>“Where’s the dog?” the Squire asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Bycyrus, “It was this way:
As I was walking home, Fido looked up at me
and said: ‘I wonder if your father still goes
out with the cook.’ So I killed poor Fido.”</p>

<p>“Bycyrus,” earnestly inquired the Squire,
“are you sure that dog is dead?”</p>

<h3>Wow, Zowie?</h3>

<p>The colonel of a British regiment returned
home in a very angry mood, and when questioned
by his wife as to the cause, replied:
“Why, that Yankee captain attached to us
boasted in the mess today that he had kissed
every officer’s wife in the regiment but one.”</p>

<p>“My word,” replied his wife, “I wonder who
she can be.”</p>

<h2><i>Our Movie Gossip</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Trust Hollywood to have the latest in
fads, but as in lots of cases, they are
short lived. A few months ago Madam
Edith Maida Lessing built her temple in Glasswell
Park, high above Hollywood, and said,
“Here will I commune with the eternal, here
will I show the bungalow sweeties that I am no
piker.” So she gathered her subjects about her
and taught them that civil marriage is the
bunk, ownership of land is terrible, churches,
penitentiaries are awful, divine marriage is the
berries, barter and exchange are the biscuits,
free trade and religious transformation is the
hot dog.</p>

<p>So divine marriage prevailed, it consisted
of taking a person as your mate in the sight
of God and when tired of them give them the
gate, and daily and nightly they gamboled
lightly on the lee, little elfins scantily clad
could be seen flitting hither and thither in
the moonlight and they held earthly communication
in the doorways; in the early mornings
could be seen the spirit dance around the red
flag of love, and many a bungalow sweetie
could be seen looking longingly toward Glasswell
Park. It got so bad that the dearies
thought they were going to lose their sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
man and they all began to squawk in accents
bold.</p>

<p>They yelped so loud that they were heard
in Los Angeles, and straightway two noble
minions of the law set forth to quiet the rumpus.
When they arrived and asked what it was
all about, they were informed this was the temple
of Helois where the disabled vets were soon
to reside and where St. Mary’s cradle was to
be founded to care for all the babies that were
not otherwise cared for. Here was to be the
goat farm to feed said babies that their mothers
might commune with the spirits unhampered;
here was to be the boat landing where the fishermen
would land nightly after their day’s fishing
to feed the vets and the other members of
the colony. Here was everything.</p>

<p>The law was not satisfied and escorted her
forth to durance vile, and accused her of lots
of things she didn’t understand, but she remained
unruffled and when safely situated in
the county hotel, broke forth in a fit of poetry—</p>

<p class="dropcap">The other day the little town of Manhattan
on the ocean near Los Angeles passed
an ordinance setting a penalty for swimming
without the sometimes necessary bathing
suit, but they claim it was not without cause,
for it got so bad that certain persons after
swimming were going uptown for lunch without
taking the necessary time to cover their
earthly charms.</p>

<p>One night a party was held on the sands
and every one disrobed and all were enjoying
the cooling air of the evening when a stranger
was seen in the offing. Everyone grabbed
clothes and ran, intending to use another part
of the beach to refresh themselves. One dearie
was stranded in the dark, and as the rest of
the party had her clothes, was forced to wander
about until morning, which was only a few
hours away. After daylight she set out to find
some clothes.</p>

<p>Later the town heads talked it over and decided
that a person ought to wear some clothing,
if only to protect them from the chill
night air, so now if you go to Manhattan to
swim, take something along to wear, even if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is only an old shirt, for, quote they, if Mack
Sennet can get away with it, “we” can.</p>

<h3>“The Four Cow Boys of the Poker Chips”</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”</i></p>

<p class="center sans">By James Starr.</p>

<p>This is a great, massive feature directed by
Dex Bygum, formerly a bartender in Cuba.
This picture is the greatest society drama that
has ever been produced about the cow country.
The story is of a man that goes to Reno to get
a divorce. Reno being a great cow town, he
soon turns to be a cowboy. While he is chasing
the “steaks” around the country, a beautiful
girl comes to Reno to get a divorce or to get
married, we don’t know which. The two fall in
love with each other and he rides her around
the town in a side car on a bicycle. They have
great times together for a while until he starts
to playing marbles for money. This gambling
scene would make Monte Carlo turn green with
envy. The girl tells the man that if he doesn’t
stop gambling, she’ll leave him forever. He
goes from bad to worse and starts to play
lawn dice. She is heart-broken and leaves the
town. That night he and four cowboys start
to play poker. The four cowboys leave the
dive with all of the poker chips. The man is
broke and discouraged, so he takes a writing
“Tablet” and dies in a few minutes. This is the
only drama we’ve seen with a true-to-life ending.
It is without a doubt the greatest non-star
picture ever produced. We don’t see how
they did it.</p>

<h3>“High Steppin’”</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From “Deception”</i></p>

<p class="center sans">By James Starr.</p>

<p>This is a story of the wild parties they had
during the time English history was originated.
From the looks of this picture they had
a wild and wicked time. The hero had six
wives; that’s enough to make any picture worth
watching. The time is during the reign of
Henry the Flivver. Without a doubt he was
a rattling good King because he found the Ford
that would go fifty miles on a bucket of oats.
There’s a mystery about the old birds doing
the “toddle” in the second reel; they pull a
mean dance and if it hadn’t been for a gang of
sub-titles we’d have seen a wicked time. Old
Henry as a king was a much better joker. The
greatest thing that he ever said was, “If I ever
lose my Kingdom, I’ll sell shoe strings on
Broadway so I can have my near-beer.” He
meant every word of it, too. Old Henry was
a real wicked hero, they usually let the villain
have the part, but to save the cost of another
actor, they had old Henry do it. The old Monarch
was fond of playing crap and reading the
sixteenth century funny paper. One of his
favorites in the funny paper was “Omar, the
tentmaker,” who is now still acting foolish on
the American stage. This picture is not quite
as wicked as “The Queen of She Bare,” but it
will do just the same.</p>

had been asked for the time of day and said:
“Why didn’t you tell that poor fellow the time?
I never thought that anyone could be so uncivil.”</p>

turned and said: “D-d-d-do y-y-y-you t-t-think

<p>The Irishman soon knocked the Fritzie off
his feet. Heinie got up, shook his head and,
catching the Irishman off his guard, hit him
for a goal. Pat came back fast and furious,
and so the battle waged fast and faster—when

sheer exhaustion, cried out—“Sufficient.”</p>

<p>Pat shook hands with him and said: “I’ve

<h2><i>“A Fool’s Paradise”</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor of People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Palm Beach is the place where the palm
is held out for your money as soon as you
land. Here nothing is free save the air,
looks and morals of the visitors. On the beach
color, costume, commotion, low necks, high
skirts, bare legs, wicked winks and studied
poses kindle the onlooker’s thoughts into a
flame that Neptune cannot put out. This is
the place for high jinks that would shame the
half-naked savages of the South Seas and outdo
the love-antics of the nymphs and gods in old
mythology.</p>

<p>Dinner is the day’s event at the Poinciana
Hotel. ’Tis a thrilling sight to see an army
of waiters “charge” through miles of dinner
table trenches, while the guests, armed with
sabre knives and bayonet forks, fight to get
food. After the attack the survivors sit around
in the lobby, stand or march about the miles of
halls and foyers, shooting glances at each other
and attempting to make “conquests.” Despite
the heat of the room, there were many chilling
glances and cold shoulders if you were not one
of the “regulars.” Giddy boys and girls, thoroughbred
sports of men and women, were all
there to see and be seen, to show all they dared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to flaunt their gold and diamonds and exhibit
everything they could on their outside which
did but advertise the naked poverty of their
inner mentality and morality.</p>

<p>Amid all this glare, gold and giddiness, I
watched an old woman, who was out of the
society race, but painfully anxious to be noticed.
This slave of fashion with rope of
pearls around her neck, bosom bound round
with chains of gold, and handcuffed with bracelets,
leaned back in her chair. When she saw
me look at her she raised the lace on her breast
that I might see her hidden diamonds, then
rested her withered arms for me to admire her
bracelets, moved her bony, be-diamonded fingers,
heaved her upholstered bosom and writhed
her wrinkled, snaky neck.</p>

<p>Ye Gods, what a sight! This last leaf on
Life’s tree—this winter of discontent amid these
tropical surroundings—this dying spark in
life’s conflagration of passion—this woman of
three score years making this unholy show of
herself, when she ought to be in bed or with a
Bible on her knees preparing to meet her God.
This after-dinner sideshow was a fulsome fiesta
of Fashion, a vicious Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>The “Beach Club” is the Monte Carlo of the
U. S. A. To gain admission you must be a
member, or be vouched for by a member in
good standing. I met a member who offered
to take me in and show me around. I had seen
the real Monte Carlo abroad and was told this
was like it with its games and sports. I did
manage to get by the Cerberus at the door, but
was then politely stopped by a smiling, monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
flunkey with an expression of “Thus far shalt
thou go and go further.” He informed me I
couldn’t enter without being in evening dress.
Since I was like the man in the Scripture, without
the wedding garment, I was cast out. Nevertheless,
at the door I saw two old satyrs taking
a chance with two powdered, painted dames,
who in life’s game had lost everything worth
having. One of the girls was tipsy. They
made some fly remarks and were welcomed in.</p>

<p>This “Beach” Club is a place of financial
and moral wrecks. It is openly run in defiance
of the Florida state law against gambling.
There is not a law of man or God that it does
not break, except the one that unless you wear
a tuxedo or Prince Albert you cannot enter.
Here hearts, heads and bank accounts are
broken. Fabulous amounts exchange hands
among the players. If you are just a looker-on
you pay for the privilege—a dollar for a glass
of water or ten dollars a plate for a light
luncheon. Question: Why does the government
pinch the little gamblers and permit this
“White House” to be a black palace of ruin and
despair?</p>

<p>There is some excuse for the routine of an
insane asylum but none for the silly Palm
Beach daily program. Here it is: Yawns, idleness,
ennui and indigestion; dressing for beach
and undressing for dinner; sun-tan of the
“Browning Club” and tonic baths; whisking
around in an invalid wheel chair in company of
dudes and pug-dogs; driveling talk of clothes
and looks; drinking pink tea or cocktails; reading
the latest trash; spooning, dancing, flirting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
golfing, yachting, sporting, and parading
high-priced dogs, cats and monkeys whose mentality
and morals are often higher than their
owners’.</p>

<p>Even Mother Nature here is togged out in
society form, laced and corseted. Trees and
flowers are trimmed out of all picturesqueness;
natural curves give way to geometrical squares;
lawns are imprisoned in concrete curbs; the air
is perfumed with the balmy fragrance of cigarettes
and cigars; there in no rest found beneath
palms, fruit trees or among plants and flowers
on account of the stinging swarms of society
gnats. Florid Florida folders describe Palm
Beach as “paradise,” but the attractions to me
were outside of the garden. Everything is
over-estimated. It is very far from the luxuriance
of Hawaii, the sport of Monte Carlo,
the beauty and history of Mediterranean
resorts. It takes more than a railroad and a
big hotel to beat them.</p>

<p>Palm Beach pauperizes and provokes. Her
short season sickens and shames. She is the
painted, pampered prostitute of Florida. “Do
as you damn please” is her motto. This was
no place for a minister’s son, so I stood not upon
the order of my going, but went by the first
midnight train—before I lost all my money and
morals.</p>

<h2><i>Our New York Gossip</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Heaven forbid that I should be catty
about this; but I marvel at the new
medical malady introduced into the world
by the great Mlle. Suzanne Lenglen, the French
tennis star.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar kind of bronchial cough that
only comes on when you are getting licked.
The peculiarity of the disease that the paroxysm
of coughing take place every time one
loses a point; the gaining of a point is followed
by an immediate, temporary recovery.</p>

<p>Brethren and sisters, I don’t want to bring
on another European war; but we gotta have
the truth about this French jane who came over
here to mop up the tennis courts with our
American girls.</p>

<p>The real malady from which Mlle. Lenglen
was suffering was an overdose of publicity.
They tell me that, at the time of the Olympic
games in Belgium, the French star had begun
to believe that the rest of the firmament where
she was not was a comparatively dull affair.</p>

<p>One day, at Antwerp, she arrived at the
stadium without her ticket of admission. To
the gatekeeper who held out his mit for the
accustomed cardboard, she said with freezing
hauteur, “I am the great Lenglen.” I don’t
know what the gatekeeper did; I suppose he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dropped dead and was carried out by the heels;
but anyhow, that is what she said.</p>

<p>When she arrived in America, the little
French girl did a very foolish thing. She gave
out an interview loftily pooh-poohing all the
American stars—especially Molla Bjurstedt
Mallory, whom she said she had defeated without
trying.</p>

<p>Now it happens that Molla is a sweet, kind-hearted,
unaffected, courageous little Norwegian
girl. She was a professional masseuse
when she came to America; but disarmed the
snobbery of the Newport tennis set by her
good sportsmanship.</p>

<p>She read the catty remarks that Lenglen
had said about her and she came out on the
tennis courts at Forest Hills looking for blood.
The dander of her Norse Viking ancestors was
up. The way she lit into the French girl filled
the latter with dismay. In the face of the tornado,
the “great Lenglen” retired shivering to
the back courts and straightway developed a
sensational cough.</p>

<p>At the end of the first set, she threw up her
hands and quit cold, leaving the courts in tears.
Molla retired from the battle in high dignity;
but as soon as the club house doors closed upon
her, she was almost smothered by the kisses
and hugs of the other girl tennis players who
had gathered for the tournament. Mlle. Lenglen
during her brief stay of two days had managed
to make herself thoroughly unpopular.</p>

<p>It is predicted that the other French champion,
Carpentier, will not be basking in quite
such a halo of hero worship when he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
back again, next winter, to fight Tom Gibbons.</p>

<p>Georges made a gallant and inspiring fight
against Jack Dempsey but, around the neighborhood,
they were not quite so strong for him.</p>

<p>It is certainly an awful thing to contemplate;
but if the new picture censors of New
York have their way, the world is due to be
a lonely void without any one-piece bathing
suit girls.</p>

<p>The first thing they did on taking office recently
was to throw out the picture of some
Dallas, Texas, young ladies who won the prizes
for having the best—well, y’ know—bathing
suits and so on.</p>

<p>Hardly had the metropolis recovered from
this shock when the censors ruthlessly stepped
on Hope Hampton’s thousand dollar bathing
suit which recently gave Atlantic City a thrill.</p>

<p>Of course, you understand that Hope’s bath
suit was made out of seal skin; and seal skin
is so awfully expensive that she naturally
couldn’t get such an awful lot of it for a thousand
dollars—and that was the kind of suit it
was.</p>

<p>The censors gave the indignant Miss Hampton
a funny reason for their official “thumbs
down” ruling. They said that her bath suit
was against the city ordinances of Atlantic City—and
they couldn’t stand for that—even if it
was in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Whereupon most of the New York papers
promptly proceeded to print both of the censor
forbidden pictures, thereby giving them about
a dozen times the publication they would have
had on the screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>It is practically a defi on the part of the
Metropolitan daily papers, who say in effect
to Governor Miller, “Why don’t you try censoring
us, too?”</p>

<p>And now we are on the subject of Hope
Hampton, they tell me that, although a really
nice little girl, Hope has begun to feel her dignity.
Not long ago, at her picture studio two
electricians were fixing an overhead light. One
of them, looking down upon the set, said, “Now
we’ve got it right. It’s right above her head.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the lovely young star stared upward
with a cold and terrible stare:</p>

<p>“Where do you get that stuff, ‘her’?” she
demanded. “When you are talking about me,
say ‘Miss Hampton.’”</p>

<p>There are alarming rumors that Hope is going
onto the stage along with the other movie
stars who are headed furiously in that direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Theda Bara, to counter-balance
the exodus, is going back to the screen
again.</p>

<p>Personally I quiver with excitement waiting
to find out if T’eda is going to be a vamp on
the screen again. She’s a queer girl—T’eda.</p>

<p>It used to be said of Oliver Goldsmith that
he wrote like an angel and talked like a fool.
Just the other way with T’eda.</p>

<p>Personally she is one of the most charming
women I ever met. She has brains, wit, philosophy,
humor and concentration. She is a brilliant
conversationalist. I once heard her talk
with a dramatist, renowned for his brilliant
conversation, and the silver-tongued genius had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
nothing on her. She simply sizzled and coruscated
with brilliancy.</p>

<p>But when she stops talking and turns to her
professional life, the brains ooze out somewhere.
The only thing worse than Theda’s pictures
was Theda’s play, put on last season. At
that, she has real ability as an actress—if she
would take up sane subjects.</p>

<p>Theda was married the other day to one
Charles Braban, a director.</p>

<p>A few days after the wedding, she was in
court testifying as a witness. They asked her
for her name. She said it was Theda Bara.</p>

<p>The lawyer was one of these bull-dozing
gents. “I want to know your real name,” he
said with cheap sarcasm.</p>

<p>The courts recently gave the lady the right
to change her legal name from Theodosia
Goodman, with which she was born, to her
stage name Theda Bara; so she replied with
dignity, “My real name is Theda Bara.” And
annihilated the lawyer with a look. The examination
had proceeded when she suddenly
shrieked, “Oh, no. Excuse me. I forgot. I am
Mrs. Charles Braban.”</p>

<p>The deeply regretted death of Caruso will
be followed by a musical revolution.</p>

<p>It is an admitted fact that no good American
name goes in musical circles. If you were
not born on the other side, you have to pretend
you were and apologize and take a foreign
moniker; or you will not be accepted in your
own, your native land.</p>

<p>The way things are now, no American singer
can possibly break in without going to Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for a long and expensive course of study—just
to get the European stamp of approval.</p>

<p>Some of the bitterest tragedies of this world
have been those of American girls who found
the doors closed to them in their own country
by foreign impressarios and who struggled
their way to Europe in order to work for German
or Italian permission to follow their own
professions in their own country. A good many
found heart-aches, poverty and other worse
tragedies over there.</p>

<p>And now coming to the point: it looks as
though the logical successor of Caruso might
be a young California boy of good old American
stock—Mario Chamley. He is a regular young
“he” American who talks baseball; goes to all
the fights and is “regular” from the basement
up. He has a glorious golden voice and has
gone to the front in the Metropolitan more
rapidly than any other young tenor in the history
of American opera. The future seems to
have boundless possibilities for him.</p>

<p>Chamley is a charming young fellow to
meet. Opera singing is just a job—like any
other—to him. He tells some outrageously funny
stories about life in an opera company.
Among other adventures, the first time he appeared
in a grand role in the Metropolitan, he
burst the waist band that held up his pants.</p>

<p>When the curtain went down and the applause
began, the excited impressario tried to
drag him out in front of the curtain.</p>

<p>The young tenor tried to tell him his pants
were coming down, but he couldn’t remember
how to say it in Italian. The impressario<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thought it was just shyness and modesty that
kept him back and tried to drag him along.
Just in time, one of the other singers, explained
the situation and the Metropolitan audience
lost a chance for a comic thrill.</p>

<p>And now, brethren, that will be about all for
today, except that the press agent of the Ziegfield
Follies has announced with heat of excitement
that the girls have formed a club to
prosecute and reply to those who say they go
to rough parties and live wild lives. Cross my
heart, I have always believed that the Ziegfield

<h3>Making It Perfectly Clear</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Although tradition holds the devil was
masculine, there is at least one person in
the world who would dispute tradition
and stamp the evil one a woman. You may not
agree with him, but then again you may, so
here’s the poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As the story is told, in the ages of old,</div>
<div class="verse">The devil, a spirit, was free,</div>
<div class="verse">To wander at will, mid the good and the ill,</div>
<div class="verse">So the devil a roaming went he.</div>
<div class="verse">In a garden he met an old man and his pet,</div>
<div class="verse">And straightway enamored was he</div>
<div class="verse">With Eve, young and cute, so he gave her some fruit,</div>
<div class="verse">For the devil a serpent could be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then she put on a skirt and made Adam a shirt—</div>
<div class="verse">A cunning young vixen was she—</div>
<div class="verse">Concealing her charms, yet displaying her arms,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the devil he chuckled in glee.</div>
<div class="verse">For he saw at a glance that his charms would enhance</div>
<div class="verse">If only a female were he;</div>
<div class="verse">So, donning her clothes, through creation he goes,</div>
<div class="verse">And the devil a woman is she!</div>

<div class="verse">“<i>Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Holy angels guard thy bed,</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">were the soft sweet words I heard as I passed
by a little cottage home. Glancing in the open
doorway, I saw a young mother rocking her
baby to sleep. It recalled the voice of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mother who sings to me across the years of
babyhood, youth and manhood.</p>

<p>In memory’s light I see the old cradle. It
was a homely thing. The sides sloped, it was
just wide enough for a baby’s arms to reach
across, high enough for the little sister to look
over, and the brother to learn to walk by. It
was shaped like a kind of Noah’s Ark, but in
it we children rocked and rode safely over all
the storms of early years.</p>

<p>It had a wooden canopy at the head. As
we looked up, it must have seemed like the edge
of the world, or a dark background on which
to paint awful childish fancies. Sometimes a
loud man or an ugly woman looked over it into
our faces, spoke, and we were frightened and
cried, but mother came and smiled the tears
away.</p>

<p>The rockers were curved and turned over at
the end, and were worn smooth and gray.
Weary with work, mother sat by our side,
placed her tired foot on the rocker, and to the
time beat of a loving heart, rocked us to sleep
as she knitted, sewed, mended, thought or
prayed.</p>

<p>For many years the old cradle was going
most of the time. Again and again a big baby
was taken out of the cradle and a small one
put in. She sang as only the mother can, whose
child is born of pain and baptized with tears.</p>

<p>It was a lullaby sweet and low, like hum of
bees in summertime; a song in a nursery, and
not in a concert hall; a song not for the many
but for just one pair of little ears which heard
and loved and understood. It was rock, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sing, for nap by day and long sleep by night;
rock and sing when well and glad or sick and
sad. One day the cradle was stilled, the little
brother, Gordon, was sound asleep, his long
lashes cast shadows on the upturned cheek,
and the little fingers had changed a red rose
for a white lily. His cradle had rocked him
nearer to the tomb for “birth is nothing but our
death begun.”</p>

<p>Dear cradle of childhood, that rested so
many tired bodies and soothed so many hearts.
Today the old cradle is in the dark garret and
the tired mother rests in the dark grave. The
hands that laid the pillow and spread the cover
have stopped their work; the foot that rocked
it has finished its journey; the face that hovered
above it is gone and the song she sang is
silent.</p>

<p>Baby boys and girls are men and women
now, but they can never forget the old cradle.
How often when body, mind and heart ache we
toss and cry during the long night hours, and
wish that mother could hug, kiss and put us
in the old cradle again and rock and sing us
to sleep.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We note with amusement that certain
of the sanctimonious sect still are passing
“resolutions” about the Dempsey-Carpentier
fistic embroglio, deploring the same
as a “disgrace to our civilization.” These are
the same “birds” who would have us scrap our
navy and reduce the army to a squad of boy
scouts with Easter lilies in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A “prize fight” is no more brutal than any
other manifestation of power; no more “disgraceful”
in what we call civilization than any
other application of force. Force rules the
universe; nothing can resist it. It would take
physical force to maintain any law against
prize fighting just as it takes physical force to
keep the bathing beauties from discarding their
two-ounce outfits as too burdensome to wear.</p>

<p>Prize fighting is a “disgrace to civilization”
only because it is mercenary, venal, sordid; yet
we loan our money on mortgages and sell our
goods at a profit with never a thought of disagreeable
civilization. The fighter sells his
ability to clout another prize fighter on the chin
before the other bambino of the bulging biceps
bangs him on his own proboscis.</p>

<p>The power of the state is behind all human
law and activity—the threat of physical enforcement
keeps Pedro, Jr., out of Neighbor
Jones’ alfalfa patch. Society is protected by
force and sometimes with arms. Our civilization
is merely armed resistance to “barbarism”
and the brutality is always under the thin pretense
of “culture” and “refinement.”</p>

<p>We have no desire to see America a nation
of male toe dancers. Let there be “prize fighting”
if it is to help save the country from the
bigotry of the organized minority. If we don’t
look out we’ll soon be as unprotected as a toke
point oyster on the half shell—and it will be
the folk who are raving about prize fighting
that will do it.</p>

<h3>Ikey’s New Bank</h3>

<p>Ikey was talking to his Yiddish merchant
friend in the latter’s store when the dealer’s
young son toddled in and said, “Papa, give me
some money.” The father reached in his pocket
and handed the boy a quarter. His friend appeared
rather shocked at the show of liberality.
“Why, how much spending money do you
give that kid every week?” he asked. Levy
replied, “Only three quarters.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’re too extravagant
with a child?”</p>

<h3>Our Paris Letter</h3>

<p>A Jack Johnson burst over the shell hole
into which Pat and Mike had crawled. “Oi’ve
been shot in the foot,” said Pat. Mike immediately
placed Pat on his shoulder and started
for the hospital. On his way there another
shell took off Pat’s head. Arriving at the first
aid station, the sentry hailed Mike.</p>

<p>“No use bringing any dead men in here,”
he said. “That fellow’s head has been shot
off.”</p>

<p>“Why, the son-of-a-gun,” exclaimed Mike,
“he told me it was his foot.”</p>

</div>

<p>Boarding our Interborough subway car at
Columbus Circle the other day en route for our
office—or, to be more exact, the office in which
we have desk room—we espied one of the loveliest
young feminine creatures it had ever yet
been our good fortune to gaze on. She would
have inspired artists to undreamed of masterpieces—she
would have thrilled even a sign-painter.
Bathed in her beauty we rode on, oblivious
of all else—even our getting off stop.
How we wished that we knew her! At Times
Square she arose to alight. Poor girl—she was
lame.</p>

<p>Still reflecting on this, we reached the office
and started to put the final—not finishing—touches
to the musical composition we were
then at work on, a snappy little one-step entitled
“When My Baby Smiles at Me, I Wish
She’d See a Dentist.” We had no sooner put
pen to paper when one of these wandering
salesmen entered the office and planked down
his bag of wares on the desk. “Would you be
interested in anything in ladies’ silk stockings?”
he said. “We used to be,” we replied.
“But now we know it’s best to be careful.”</p>

<p>During that day we had to make a trip
further downtown, and so used the subway
again. Seated opposite to us was a very nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
girl with her mother, and her legs were crossed—that
is, the girl’s legs were. As Gus may
remember, or rather, as Gus will never forget,
there is a subway breeze wafting through these
cars, and it was wafting just then. The mother
noticed it, and although she spoke sotto voice—whatever
that is—we heard her say to the girl:
“Put your leg down, Rosie, der vind ist blowin’
der dress up.” “That’s all right, ma,” said the
girl, “I ain’t deformed.” And seated directly
opposite, we knew that the lady was quite correct.</p>

<p>While waiting with a friend the other evening
for a Times Square traffic jam to disentangle
itself, the friend drew our attention
to a taxicab stalled at the curb just where we
were standing. Or, to be precise, he drew our
attention to the contents of the cab. She was
a queen if there ever was one. Said our friend:
“Shouldn’t mind being in there with that one.”
“We should,” we replied. “Already the clock
says $9.60.”</p>

<h3>Our War Drama</h3>

<p>While in New York City recently, a member
of the Wild Cat Division, now employed in
the McAlpin Hotel, related an anecdote on
Paddy O’Loughlin, one of the division headquarter
shuffers. It was after the armistice
had been signed that Paddy made a flying trip
to Paris, via his trusty flivver. Upon his return
he made the following report to his buddies:</p>

<p>“The war ain’t finished yet, be gorra, by a
hekuva sight. The battle in Paris, which is
going on right now, is a darn sight worse than
we had with the Boche. It’s a whole lot different
kind of war, but a fellow isn’t any safer
on the Grand Boulevard than he was in front
of a German machine gun nest.</p>

<p>“The attack started no more than I hit Paris
and it got worse every minute until I left.
You bet I was lucky to come out alive. The
enemy approached me as soon as I stepped out
of my truck and opened fire. She swooped down
on me like a thirsty Irishman pounces on a
glass of suds, grabbed hold of me by the arm
just like we used to nab the German prisoners
and tried to carry me off. I broke away from
her, but I hadn’t gone more than fifty feet before
I met another detachment of the enemy.
There were two of them this time. Say, talk
about your camouflage! The Germans or
French neither never had nothing on them.
Their lips were made up like strawberries, and
their eyes—oh, la! la!</p>

<p>“They tried the same game on me and tried
to carry me away, but I got away from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
When I hit the Boulevard, it was just like trying
to run through a heavy barrage. They
were all over, little cute one pounders and big
heavy seventy-fives. They used the old German
mass formation on me and when I tried to push
through, it was worse than climbing over barb
wire entanglements in No Man’s Land. The rate
of fire got hotter every minute. I didn’t want
to do it but there were too many of them and
I had to holler ‘Kamerad.’”</p>

<p>We tried to get “Paddy” to tell what happened
after that, but he blushed and said that
was all.</p>

<h3>The Horse That Wins the Race</h3>

<div class="poetry-container smaller">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If you ever go to races I think you’ll agree,</div>
<div class="verse">In the following philosophy which oft occurred to me;</div>
<div class="verse">Some horses start off slowly and others make the pace,</div>
<div class="verse">But the first horse at the wire is the horse that wins the race.</div>
<div class="verse">It doesn’t always matter which jockey has your mount,</div>
<div class="verse">When they rally down the homestretch, one thing alone will count,</div>
<div class="verse">Luck often passes merit, and for better or for worse,</div>
<div class="verse">The rear horse gets his lashing and the front horse takes the purse,</div>
<div class="verse">When dealing cards in poker you are liable to find</div>
<div class="verse">That two pair seldom rank as high as three cards of a kind.</div>
<div class="verse">The King card is high card but it doesn’t beat the ace:</div>
<div class="verse">The first horse at the wire is the one that wins the race.</div>
<div class="verse">Just look the records over, and you’ll stay with me, I guess,</div>
<div class="verse">That really, for succeeding, there’s nothing like success;</div>
<div class="verse">The world will surely judge you by the things that you have done!</div>
<div class="verse">You will only get its pity for your battles nearly won.</div>
<div class="verse">Reputation isn’t always what it’s lauded up to be,</div>
<div class="verse">The shallow brooks are noisiest, down flowing to the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Great genius sometimes hides itself within the common face;</div>
<div class="verse">Dark horses beat the favorites to many a gallant race.</div>
<div class="verse">Endeavor may be noble, but the world doesn’t care a pin,</div>
<div class="verse">For an ocean of endeavors unless they chance to win.</div>
<div class="verse">Finish what you’ve undertaken if you want to make a name</div>
<div class="verse">Success has filled the niches in the temple walls of Fame.</div>
<div class="verse">The most successful doctor is the one that most is paid,</div>
<div class="verse">The merchant who most prospers is the one who gets the trade,</div>
<div class="verse">The most successful lawyer is the one who wins the case,</div>
<div class="verse">And the first horse at the wire is the horse that wins the race,</div>
<div class="verse">I often think it’s pretty hard that things should be just so,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But you have to buy your ticket if you want to see the show.</div>
<div class="verse">It’s the front of the procession where you always hear the band,</div>
<div class="verse">And the boy who gets hot peanuts is the first one at the stand.</div>
<div class="verse">So make your tablets ready and jot these maxims down;</div>
<div class="verse">It’s the peasant does the hustling and the king that wears the crown.</div>
<div class="verse">The man who gets the fox’s brush is the foremost in the chase,</div>
<div class="verse">And the first horse at the wire is the horse that wins the race.</div>

<h3>Our Exchange Story</h3>

<p>In the days when Lord Kitchener, the invincible
bachelor, was remaking the British Indian
forces, a youthful officer asked for a furlough
to go home and be married. Kitchener
listened patiently, and then spoke kindly.
“Kenilworth, you’re not yet twenty-five. You’re
in the midst of a piece of work I value and
which you’re doing excellently. Wait a year.
By that time you’ll have cleaned the slate and
tried out your own mind. If then you still desire
to do this thing, speak to me again, and
you shall have leave; and I’ll take you back on
the staff afterwards.” The year passed, and
the officer once more proffered his request.
“And you really tell me,” asked Kitchener,
“that after thinking it over for twelve months
you still wish to marry?” “Yes, sir, very much
indeed.” “Adjutant,” commanded Kitchener,
“Kenilworth is to have furlough to go to his
own wedding. And frankly, my boy, I scarcely
thought there was so much constancy in the
masculine world.” Kenilworth about faced and
marched to the door, but there turned and said,
“Thank you, sir. Only it’s not the same
woman.”</p>
